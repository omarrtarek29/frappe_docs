# Frappe Reference Documentation

This repository serves as a quick reference guide and collection of helpful code snippets for the Frappe Framework. It contains practical examples, common patterns, fixes for known issues, and time-saving hacks.

## Purpose

- Provide fast access to code patterns and solutions
- Document workarounds for common Frappe challenges
- Share practical examples with minimal boilerplate
- Serve as a personal reference for Frappe development

## Organization

The documentation is organized into three main categories:

- **JS Docs**: JavaScript-related patterns for client-side development
- **Python Docs**: Server-side Python implementations and patterns
- **Server Docs**: Administrative commands and maintenance operations

Each section contains topic-specific files that group related functionality together for easy reference.
